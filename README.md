## Overview

Tetris is a popular puzzle game where the player's objective is to manipulate falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes) to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a complete line is formed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game continues until the playing field is filled to the top.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay.
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Scoring system to keep track of your progress.
- Sound effects and music (toggleable).
- Game over condition when the grid is filled.
- Pause and resume functionality.
- High-quality graphics using Pygame.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

## Controls

- Left Arrow Key: Move the falling block to the left.
- Right Arrow Key: Move the falling block to the right.
- Up Arrow Key: Rotate the falling block 90 degrees clockwise.
- Down Arrow Key: Increase the falling speed of the block.
- "P" Key: Pause and resume the game.
- "M" Key: Toggle music and sound effects on or off.
- Escape (Esc) Key: Prompt a dialog box to ask if you want to conclude the game.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to complete as many lines as possible by arranging the falling tetrominoes to create full horizontal lines without gaps. When you complete a line, it disappears, and you earn points. The game continues until there's no more room for new blocks to enter play, leading to a game over.
